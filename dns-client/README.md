# A Python DNS Client

This DNS client is similar in nature to `nslookup` or `host` but only deals with A records.
Note that this DNS client does not use any DNS libraries but rather works directly

# Quick Start

```
chmod +x dns_client.py
./dns_client.py abc.com
```
OR for local server
```
chmod +x dns_client.py
./dns_client.py abc.com 127.0.0.1
```
